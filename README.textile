h1. MikeBot

In (electric) guitar recording the positioning of the microphone in front of the amp or cabinet has a major impact on the sound. MikeBot is a device to adjust the microphone position remotely. It features two linear and one rotational axis. The device has two interfaces: Classic MIDI and MIDI over USB. This repository contains the controller PCB, schematics, firmware and configuration utilities. The mechanical drawings will follow.

Please note that this is work in progress and the board has not been proven yet.
